# Publication and citation

## How to cite

Cite this work via its minted DOI or repository:

> Friedman, D. A. (2026). *The Witness Register: Co-Registration Without Aggregation* (version
> 0.1.0) [Software and manuscript]. Zenodo.
> <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.21754246>

BibTeX:

```bibtex
@software{friedman_witness_register_2026,
  author  = {Friedman, Daniel Ari},
  title   = {The Witness Register: Co-Registration Without Aggregation},
  version = {0.1.0},
  year    = {2026},
  doi     = {10.5281/zenodo.21754246}
}
```

`CITATION.cff` carries the same metadata in machine-readable form, and
`.zenodo.json` carries the deposit metadata. All three are generated from
`manuscript/config.yaml`; `tests/test_publication_metadata.py` fails if they
disagree.

## Persistent Identifiers and Verification

This repository carries an asserted, verified Zenodo DOI (`10.5281/zenodo.21754246`).
`tests/test_publication_metadata.py` refuses any unverified DOI-shaped string in
the citation metadata unless that exact DOI is listed as verified inside the test
itself. A placeholder DOI that renders like a real one is worse than no DOI: it
survives copy-and-paste into someone else's bibliography and points nowhere.

## Reserving and Minting DOIs (reserve-first order)

1. Create the Zenodo deposition **without publishing it**, and reserve its DOI.
2. Record the reserved DOI in this repository: add it under `identifiers:` in
   `CITATION.cff`, add it to `related_identifiers` in `.zenodo.json` if
   relevant, add `publication.doi` to `manuscript/config.yaml`, and add the
   exact string to the verified list in `tests/test_publication_metadata.py`.
   The gate turns green only when a person has asserted the DOI is real.
3. Re-render the manuscript so the printed artifact carries its own DOI. A PDF
   deposited without its DOI on the cover cannot be cited from the paper alone.
4. Upload the re-rendered artifacts and publish the deposition.

## The other works

This work is one of six. They reference each other by name, repository URL, and
verified DOI. No work imports another, and the shared report-envelope schema
string is aligned by published convention rather than by dependency.

| `line_set` | the reader that declares the set and checks vocabulary separation | <https://github.com/docxology/line_set> | `https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.21754244` |

## Before the repository goes public

- [ ] Every gate in `AGENTS.md` green on a clean checkout.
- [ ] `LICENSE` present and accurate.
- [ ] No absolute local paths, secrets, or private-project names in any tracked
      file (`tests/test_publication_metadata.py` checks the first of these).
- [ ] Git history contains nothing that should not be public — the published
      history is a fresh initial-release commit, not a monorepo extract.
- [ ] The rendered PDF regenerated at the release tree.
